## Overview 
- This project has 2 components:
1. Physics engine capable of resolving simple motion and collisions for 3D rigid-bodies.
2. Showcasting engine capabilities with the help of a 3D simulation of autonomous cube robots intereacting among themselves.

## Getting Started
1. Download project file from repository.
2. Execute the "index.html" file.
3. For the best experience, it is recommended to use the Chrome browser.

## Usage
1. Select number of robots to be generated with the help of the "Number of Robot" slider.
2. Click the "Refresh" button.
3. Select desired piston output force with the help of the "Piston Output Force" slider. 
4. Select desired mass of cube with the help of the "Mass of Cube Robot" slider. 
5. Any time number of robots needs to be updated, select new number of robots and click "Refresh".
